## Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This project applies various classification algorithms to predict the survival status of passengers based on their attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers such as their age, sex, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

## Models Used

The following classification models are implemented in the notebook:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost
- ANN (deep learning model buil from scratch)

## Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results

### Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 0.78
- Precision (weighted avg): 0.79
- Recall (weighted avg): 0.78
- F1-Score (weighted avg): 0.77

### Random Forest
- Accuracy: 0.79
- Precision (weighted avg): 0.79
- Recall (weighted avg): 0.79
- F1-Score (weighted avg): 0.79

### Decision Tree
- Accuracy: 0.74
- Precision (weighted avg): 0.75
- Recall (weighted avg): 0.74
- F1-Score (weighted avg): 0.74

### XGBoost
